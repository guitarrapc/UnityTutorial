    - Create component, Script, to trace Player position
        - as FPS
        - as TPS
- [x] Prefab
    - [Tutorial 4](https://github.com/unity3d-jp/FirstTutorial/wiki/4.%E3%82%A2%E3%82%A4%E3%83%86%E3%83%A0%E5%9B%9E%E5%8F%8E%E3%81%AE%E8%BF%BD%E5%8A%A0)
    - [x] What Prefab is.
        - [Unity - Prefab](http://docs.unity3d.com/ja/current/Manual/Prefabs.html)
        - Instance of Asset?
        - All GameObject created from Prefab can be handle as Class Instance.
        - It means if you add some material to a Prefab, not to GameObject, then all clone items created from a Prefab will be apply same change.
        - After you create instance of Prefab, you can set each instance of GameObject position, rotation and others.
    - [x] Why Prefab?
        - Because as Object-Oriented Programing have Class-Instance, Prefab is samething in Unity GameObject. 
    - [x] Prefab rule
        - [x] Should Position / Rotation set to be 0?
            - This is because Prefab is template of GameObject and copy will create based on Prefab. 
    - [x] Create Prefab
        - Create Folder in Projet Browser -> then drag Hierarchy item to ProjectBrowser Folder
    - [x] Position Prefab instance GameObject
    - [x] Add Colision detection by Trigger
        - [x] Change Project Item Collider to ```Is Trigger``` enabled.
        - [x] Check Collider Tag where target have expected tag or not.
            - Collider.CompareTag() : http://docs.unity3d.com/ja/current/ScriptReference/Component.CompareTag.html
            - Component.Tag : http://docs.unity3d.com/ja/current/ScriptReference/Component-tag.html
            - Tag and Layers Manager : http://docs.unity3d.com/ja/current/Manual/class-TagManager.html
            - Set Tag to Target GameObject to use Collider.CompareTag().
                - ```Inspector > Tag```, set Player.
        - [x] Destroy Self GameObject
            - Destroy(This.gameObject);
- [x] Canvas
    - [Tutorial 5](https://github.com/unity3d-jp/FirstTutorial/wiki/5.%E3%82%B1%E3%82%99%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0%E3%81%AEui%E3%82%92%E8%BF%BD%E5%8A%A0%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B)
    - [x] Create Canvas
        - Now Canvas can contains UI item to draw item inside
        - Automatically create ```EventSystem``` GameObject
    - [x] UI Scale mode to be ```Scale with Screen Size```
    - Should be better move Scene view from GAmeView like to near the Canvas. This is because GameView will draw by Canvas + SceneView Item.
- [x] Text
    - [Tutorial 5](https://github.com/unity3d-jp/FirstTutorial/wiki/5.%E3%82%B1%E3%82%99%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0%E3%81%AEui%E3%82%92%E8%BF%BD%E5%8A%A0%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B)

    - Message Dispatcher from Event to the Text
    - [x] Create Empty
    - [x] Taging with ```GameController```
    - [x] Apply ```Item``` Tag to Prefab item ```Item```.
        - This apply tag change to all instantiate items.
    - [x] Create GameController Script 
        - [x] Count up Taged items and apply change to Label.
            - ```GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag (<string>tagName).Length```
        - [x] Create public field to accept Label GameObject binding with Script.
        - [x] Apply count change to label.text.
    - [x] Bind Script to GameController
    - [x] Bind Lebel to GameController Script Public Field by drag and drop Label in Hieralchy -> GameController Inspector > GameController public Field.
- [x] Tag and Layer
    - [Tutorial 5](https://github.com/unity3d-jp/FirstTutorial/wiki/5.%E3%82%B1%E3%82%99%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0%E3%81%AEui%E3%82%92%E8%BF%BD%E5%8A%A0%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B)
    - [x] Add Tag by ```Menu bar > Edit > Tags and Layer``` add Tags by + and set name.
    - Add ```Item``` Tag.
- [x] Position fix
    - If you had set GameObject inside Empty, then Empty is Parent and items inside will be children.
    - All Children position is based on Parent position.
        - This means if Parent position is 10, 10, 10 then even if you sat children position 0,0,0 world position will be calculated from parent position 10,10,10.
    - Would be better always set parent as 0, 0, 0?
- [x] Active
    - [Tutorial 6](https://github.com/unity3d-jp/FirstTutorial/wiki/6.%E3%82%B1%E3%82%99%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0%E3%81%AE%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA%E3%82%A2%E3%82%92%E8%BF%BD%E5%8A%A0%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B)
    - All GameObject have property ```Active```
        - If you set this as InActive, then GameObject will not be show in GameView.
        - So it can be use for timing when to show GameObject.
    - [x] Create ```Lable``` for Finish -> FinishLabel.
        - [x] Set position and default text
        - [x] Set Item as InActive at Inspector (means default)
    - [x] create public field to GameController to accept ```GameObject``` of FinishLabel
        - [x] Bind FinishLabel to the Script from Inspector
