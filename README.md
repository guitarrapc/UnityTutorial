    - [x] What Prefab is.
        - [Unity - Prefab](http://docs.unity3d.com/ja/current/Manual/Prefabs.html)
        - Instance of Asset?
        - All GameObject created from Prefab can be handle as Class Instance.
        - It means if you add some material to a Prefab, not to GameObject, then all clone items created from a Prefab will be apply same change.
        - After you create instance of Prefab, you can set each instance of GameObject position, rotation and others.
    - [x] Why Prefab?
        - Because as Object-Oriented Programing have Class-Instance, Prefab is samething in Unity GameObject. 
    - [x] Prefab rule
        - [x] Should Position / Rotation set to be 0?
            - This is because Prefab is template of GameObject and copy will create based on Prefab. 
    - [x] Create Prefab
        - Create Folder in Projet Browser -> then drag Hierarchy item to ProjectBrowser Folder
    - [x] Position Prefab instance GameObject
    - [x] Add Colision detection by Trigger

            - Component.Tag : http://docs.unity3d.com/ja/current/ScriptReference/Component-tag.html
            - Tag and Layers Manager : http://docs.unity3d.com/ja/current/Manual/class-TagManager.html
            - Set Tag to Target GameObject to use Collider.CompareTag().
                - ```Inspector > Tag```, set Player.
        - [x] Destroy Self GameObject
            - Destroy(This.gameObject);
- [x] Canvas
    - [Tutorial 5](https://github.com/unity3d-jp/FirstTutorial/wiki/5.%E3%82%B1%E3%82%99%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0%E3%81%AEui%E3%82%92%E8%BF%BD%E5%8A%A0%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B)
    - [x] Create Canvas
        - Now Canvas can contains UI item to draw item inside
        - Automatically create ```EventSystem``` GameObject
    - [x] UI Scale mode to be ```Scale with Screen Size```
    - Should be better move Scene view from GAmeView like to near the Canvas. This is because GameView will draw by Canvas + SceneView Item.
- [x] Text
    - [Tutorial 5](https://github.com/unity3d-jp/FirstTutorial/wiki/5.%E3%82%B1%E3%82%99%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0%E3%81%AEui%E3%82%92%E8%BF%BD%E5%8A%A0%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B)

    - Message Dispatcher from Event to the Text
    - [x] Create Empty
    - [x] Taging with ```GameController```
    - [x] Apply ```Item``` Tag to Prefab item ```Item```.
        - This apply tag change to all instantiate items.
    - [x] Create GameController Script 
        - [x] Count up Taged items and apply change to Label.
            - ```GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag (<string>tagName).Length```
        - [x] Create public field to accept Label GameObject binding with Script.
        - [x] Apply count change to label.text.

    - [x] Add Tag by ```Menu bar > Edit > Tags and Layer``` add Tags by + and set name.
    - Add ```Item``` Tag.
- [x] Position fix
    - If you had set GameObject inside Empty, then Empty is Parent and items inside will be children.
    - All Children position is based on Parent position.
        - This means if Parent position is 10, 10, 10 then even if you sat children position 0,0,0 world position will be calculated from parent position 10,10,10.
    - Would be better always set parent as 0, 0, 0?
- [x] Active
    - [Tutorial 6](https://github.com/unity3d-jp/FirstTutorial/wiki/6.%E3%82%B1%E3%82%99%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0%E3%81%AE%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA%E3%82%A2%E3%82%92%E8%BF%BD%E5%8A%A0%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B)
    - All GameObject have property ```Active```
        - If you set this as InActive, then GameObject will not be show in GameView.
        - So it can be use for timing when to show GameObject.
    - [x] Create ```Lable``` for Finish -> FinishLabel.
        - [x] Set position and default text
        - [x] Set Item as InActive at Inspector (means default)

    - 1 Texture would be contains more than 1 Sprite because of it's efficiecy.
         - Problem is "How to devide sprite for each GameObject from 1 Texture."
         - Resolution is set Sprite area in Texture when import texture. 
    - [x] Open ```Sprite Editor``` from Inspector View
    - [x] Select ```Slice``` on left top.
        - [x] Type == ```Automatic``` means automatically slice Sprite.
        - [x] Change Type to ```Grid by cell Size```

    - [x] Remove ```Apply Root Motion``` for 2D.
        - It doesn't use in 2D and will be break what you desire.
- [x] Rigidbody2D
    - [Tutorial 2](https://github.com/unity3d-jp-tutorials/2d-shooting-game/wiki/%E7%AC%AC02%E5%9B%9E-%E3%83%97%E3%83%AC%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A4%E3%83%BC%E3%81%AE%E7%A7%BB%E5%8B%95)

            - As this game is 2D, you don't need to use Vector3.
            - Vector2 can be determine by Input. On this time use Keyboard.
        - [x] Normalize Vector
            - With 2D, direction can be determine by Unit Vector.
            - This can be calculate from ```normalized``` reaonly property like ```Vector2(x, y).normalized```
            - normalized means treat magnitude as always 1. so you can just obtain which direction it is.
        - [x] Velocity
            - Now you can handle Direction. Velocity is rate for Acceralate.
                - Difference between Velocity property and AddForce() method is ```resistor```.
                - As Velocity is just a accelarate value, means there's no resistor condideration == max speed from first step.
                - OTH, AddForce() is method. It add acceralate to object. base object velocity is 0, so AddForce() will slowly add force. It's like there are resistor.
- [x] Camera
    - [Tutorial 2](https://github.com/unity3d-jp-tutorials/2d-shooting-game/wiki/%E7%AC%AC02%E5%9B%9E-%E3%83%97%E3%83%AC%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A4%E3%83%BC%E3%81%AE%E7%A7%BB%E5%8B%95)
    - [x] Projection
        - As this is 2D, don't need to be Perspective. Change Projection to be ```Orthographic```
        - Change ```Size``` to be 3 to limit stage size.
- [x] Add Bullet
    - [Tutorial 3](https://github.com/unity3d-jp-tutorials/2d-shooting-game/wiki/%E7%AC%AC03%E5%9B%9E-%E3%83%97%E3%83%AC%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A4%E3%83%BC%E3%81%8B%E3%82%89%E5%BC%BE%E3%82%92%E6%92%83%E3%81%A4)
    - [x] Add RigitBody2D to the bullet.
    - [x] Set Bullet position in SceneView and drag to container gameobject. (PlayerBullet)
    - [x] Create Prefab for contaier object PlayerBullet.
    - [x] Create Script and write as bullet just go up when game start.
        - Attach Script to PlayerBullet Prefab.
        - gamestart : Start()
        - set speed : public int Speed = 10;
        - for bullet, that script attached : gameobject.GetComponent<RigidBody2D>().velocity
        - just go up : .velocity = transform.up.normalized * Speed;
- [x] Coroutine
    - [Tutorial 3](https://github.com/unity3d-jp-tutorials/2d-shooting-game/wiki/%E7%AC%AC03%E5%9B%9E-%E3%83%97%E3%83%AC%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A4%E3%83%BC%E3%81%8B%E3%82%89%E5%BC%BE%E3%82%92%E6%92%83%E3%81%A4)
    - [Unity - Cotoutine](http://docs.unity3d.com/ja/current/Manual/Coroutines.html)
    - IEnumerator to control function execution timing by user script.
        - As there are ```Update()``` Method to call function in every frame, and can be easily stop Game World because of function cannot be finished in the flame AND ALSO Update() will call too match time and hard to control ```when to call next```.
        - So a lot of times Unity recomend to use ```IEnumerator Start(){ AnyFunction}``` to call you function with ```yield return```.
        - As there are Enumerator in C#, Coroutine will return yield execution result and continus on next.
        - You can controll interval of ```yield return``` with ``yield return new WaitForSeconds(float)```, besides Update() can't be controllable.
        - Just remember, Coroutine is not silver bullet. Don't do like IEnumerator Update(). just use IEnumerator Start(), and be sure to be finish function as soon as possible.

- [x] Sprite - Sorting Layer
    - [Tutorial 3](https://github.com/unity3d-jp-tutorials/2d-shooting-game/wiki/%E7%AC%AC03%E5%9B%9E-%E3%83%97%E3%83%AC%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A4%E3%83%BC%E3%81%8B%E3%82%89%E5%BC%BE%E3%82%92%E6%92%83%E3%81%A4)
    - As there are Bullet overwrite Player object. This seems not natual, it's better draw Bullet first and orverwrite with Player Object. 
    - Use ```Sorting Layer``` to control draw Sprite object order.
    - Means Last Order Item will come to the top, tand first order item will be behind the last.
    - [x] Create Sorting Layer
        - ```Edit > Project Settings > Tags and Layer``` then select ```Sorting Layer``` Add 2 layers with this order. 
            1. Bullet 
            1. Player
    - [x] Apply to Sprite.
        - Set Player Sprite's Sorting Layer to ```Player```
        - Set Bullet Sprite's sorting layer to ```Bullet```.
- [x] RequiredComponent Attribute
    - There are several Attributes in Script.
    - RequiredComponent Attribute means You must apply <RequiredComponent> to the GameObject that Script Attached. 
- [x] Call other Script
    - [Tutorial 4](https://github.com/unity3d-jp-tutorials/2d-shooting-game/wiki/%E7%AC%AC04%E5%9B%9E-%E6%95%B5%E3%82%92%E4%BD%9C%E6%88%90%E3%81%97%E3%82%88%E3%81%86)
    - You can call other class/method/property which assigned to same GameObject by GetComponent<T>.
    - Create some common script A.
    - Attach script to GameObject X.
    - Now other Script, which also attach to GameObject X, can call Script through GetComponent<T>(). 
- [x] Transform.up
    - Usually direction is calculated from World Point, there are another easy way "Transform.up".
- [x] Transform Rotation
    - In 2D, usually object direction is up. But you can flip direction to down or any with GameObject > Transform > Rotation.
- [x] Child Element GameObject
    - Create Empty Elemment under a GameObject. Now created is Child Element and affected by Parent GameObject.
    - This can be use for Component of Large GameObject, like 1 enemy have many ShotPoint. 
- [x] Collider
    - [Tutorial 5](https://github.com/unity3d-jp-tutorials/2d-shooting-game/wiki/%E7%AC%AC05%E5%9B%9E-%E5%BD%93%E3%81%9F%E3%82%8A%E5%88%A4%E5%AE%9A%E3%81%A8%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A1%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B3%E3%82%A4%E3%83%99%E3%83%B3%E3%83%88%E3%81%A8%E3%83%AC%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A4%E3%83%BC)
    - [Unity - Collier](http://docs.unity3d.com/ja/current/ScriptReference/Collider.html)
    - [UnityのRigidbodyとColliderで衝突判定](http://qiita.com/yando/items/0cd2daaf1314c0674bbe)
        - Would be better Collier and RigidBody are pair to set into Component.
        - When you add Collier, think like below.
        - If you Check on ```IsTrigger```, Collider will not reflect material and passthru. It means DroppingObject will go through the Ground.
        - ```IsTrigger``` is useful for triggering any event when Item is touched. 
    - [x] Add Collider
        - [x] Add Box Collider 2D to Player.
            - [x] Set size to 0.06 x 0.06 
        - [x] Add Polygon Collider to Enemy
            - [x] Modify Mesh for Polygon Collider is not match to the Sprite shape.
                - Open Sprite and Change Texture Type to ```Advanced```
                - Change MeshType
                - Change Extrude Edges
            - [x] Also modify Polygon Collider directly.
        - [x] Add Circle Collider to Enemy Bullet.
        - [x] Add Polygon Collider to Player Bullet.
            - [x] Copy / Paste Component
    - [x] Add Explosion Effect inside SpaceShipController
        - Instantiate Explosion GameObject at caller gameobject transform.
    - [x] Add ```OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D other)```
        - Detroy(other.gameObject)
        - call Explosion effect
        - Destroy(self)
    - [x] Handle lopp for Explosion effect.
        - Change Loop setting in Animation
        - No ```Loop Time``` means run effect only once.
    - [x] Remove Animation Effect 
        - [x] Destroy Explosion gameObject when OnAnimationFinish() event called.
        - [x] Link OnAnimationFinish Event to Animation
            - Open Animation. ```Windows > Animation```
            - Add Event > Select OnAnimationFinish function
            - Move event to when Animation Finished
    - [x] Create GameArea
        - [x] Set OnColliderExit2D(Collider collider) to destroy collider when gameobject passed GameArea.

Component | Dropping Object | Catch Ground
---- | ---- | ----
Collider  | O (Shape to material)| O (Shape to Ground)
RigidBody | O (With Gravity) | X

- [ ] Layer
    - [Tutorial 5](https://github.com/unity3d-jp-tutorials/2d-shooting-game/wiki/%E7%AC%AC05%E5%9B%9E-%E5%BD%93%E3%81%9F%E3%82%8A%E5%88%A4%E5%AE%9A%E3%81%A8%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A1%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B3%E3%82%A4%E3%83%99%E3%83%B3%E3%83%88%E3%81%A8%E3%83%AC%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A4%E3%83%BC)
    - Easiest way to handle Collider is Splitting layer.
        - In this game I need to handle following combination will NOT destloy gameobject.
            - Player Bullet - Player     
            - Enemy Bullet - Enemy
            - Player Bullet - Player Bullet
            - Enemy Bullet - Enemy Bullet
            - Player - Player
            - Enemy - Enemy
    - [x] Add Layer ```Edit > Project Settings > Tags and Layers```
        - Player
        - Enemy
        - Bullet(Player)
        - Bullet(Enemy)
        - GameArea
    - [x] Apply Layer to Prefab and GameObject.
    - [x] Create Layer collistion Matrix. ```Edit > Project Settings > Physics 2D```
        - You can hadle Layer collision with this matrix.
    - [x] Detail Handling with Script.
        - Even you set Layer Collision, Player still desloy right after game start. This is because GameArea Collision is affecting Players OnColliectionEnter2D.
        - Let's think this situation.
            - GameArea should be area to handle GameObject. Means It SHOULD DESTLOY GAMEOBJECT WHEN GAMEOBJECT is OnTriggerEnter2D.
            - This can't be handle with Layer Collision Matrix and required Script handling.
        - [x] Get Layer ```LayerMask.LayerToName(collider.gameObject.layer);```
        - [x] If check for LayerName.... By String!?
        - [x] Destroy
- [ ] BackGround
    - [Tutorial 6](https://github.com/unity3d-jp-tutorials/2d-shooting-game/wiki/%E7%AC%AC06%E5%9B%9E-%E8%83%8C%E6%99%AF%E3%82%92%E4%BD%9C%E3%82%8B)
    - [x] Quad
        - [x] Create Empty GameObject 
        - [x] Create ```3D > Quad``` inside GameObject.
        - [x] Attach BackGround Material
            - If you have several background meterials, then create multiple quad and apply each.
        - [x] Tune Z position for Visualize order.
            - larger amount will go back from smaller amount.
            - 0 will come front of 0.1
    - [ ] Move Material
        - Use SetTextureOffset to move matrieal.
        - [x] Confirm Material's Shader Texture Varialbe Name
            - Unity basic shader often use ```_MainTex```
            - You can confirm name with ```Select Matrial > Edit Shader > Compile and Show code``` ow Properties will show _MainTex or other.
        - [x] Change Texture Wrap Mode to ```Repeat```
